//strlen(a), strcpy(a,b), strcat(a,b), strchr(a,ch), strcmp(a,b)
//strlen: expects string as an arguement and returns the length of the string, excluding the NULL character
//strcat: expects two strings and copies the value of b to a
//strcat: expects two strings and concatenated result is copied back to a
//strchr: expects string and a char to be found in the string. returns address of matched char in string if found, else null is returned
//strcmp: compares whether content of array a is same as array b. if a==b, returns 0. returns 1 if array a has lexicographically higher value than array b. else, returns -1
